/**
 * Class used to provide a default implementation of a rule in SJXP.
 * <p/>
 * It is intended that you only ever need to use this class and not implement
 * your own {@link IRule} classes yourself (you are certainly welcome to
 * though).
 * <p/>
 * Rules all consist of the same boiler plate:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A {@link Type}, so we know if the rule wants to match character
 * data or attribute values.</li>
 * <li>A <code>locationPath</code>, which tells us the path to the element in
 * the XML document to match.</li>
 * <li>OPTIONAL: 1 or more <code>attributeNames</code> from the matching element
 * that we want values from.</li>
 * </ul>
 * All of that rudimentary behavior, along with some nice error-checking and an
 * easy-to-debug and caching <code>toString</code> implementation are provided
 * by this class so you can hit the ground running by simply creating an
 * instance of this class, passing it a location path and provided an
 * implementation for the handler you are interested in.
 * <p/>
 * An example would look like this:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * new DefaultRule(Type.CHARACTER, &quot;/library/book/title&quot;) {
 * 	&#064;Override
 * 	public void handleParsedCharacters(XMLParser parser, String text, T userObject) {
 * 		// Handle the title text
 * 	}
 * };
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h3>Instance Reuse</h3>
 * Instances of {@link DefaultRule} are immutable and maintain no internal
 * state, so re-using the same {@link DefaultRule} among multiple instances of
 * {@link XMLParser} is safe.
 * 
 * @param <T>
 *            The class type of any user-supplied object that the caller wishes
 *            to be passed through from one of the {@link XMLParser}'s
 *            <code>parse</code> methods directly to the handler when a rule
 *            matches. This is typically a data storage mechanism like a DAO or
 *            cache used to store the parsed value in some valuable way, but it
 *            can ultimately be anything. If you do not need to make use of the
 *            user object, there is no need to parameterize the class.
