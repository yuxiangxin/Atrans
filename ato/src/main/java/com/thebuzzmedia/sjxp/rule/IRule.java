/**
 * Interface used to describe a "rule" in SJXP.
 * <p/>
 * The most important part of a rule is its <code>locationPath</code>, this
 * literal {@link String} value is how the {@link XMLParser} matches up its
 * current position inside of an XML doc with any {@link IRule}s that want
 * information from that location.
 * <p/>
 * The <code>type</code> of the {@link IRule} indicates to the executing
 * {@link XMLParser} when the rule should be queried for a match against its
 * current position.
 * <p/>
 * All implementors must provide an implementation for the
 * <code>handleParsedXXX</code> method matching the <code>type</code> of rule
 * they have created. More specifically, if you are creating a
 * {@link Type#ATTRIBUTE} rule, you need to implement the
 * {@link #handleParsedAttribute(XMLParser, int, String, Object)} method; if you
 * are implementing a {@link Type#CHARACTER} rule, you need to implement the
 * {@link #handleParsedCharacters(XMLParser, String, Object)} method.
 * <h3>Rule Matching</h3>
 * Rules will execute every single time they match an element in an XML
 * document. There is no XPath-like expression system to tell them to only get
 * you the first, or 10th or every-other value from a document; you must
 * implement that logic yourself inside of the <code>handleParsedXXX</code>
 * handlers.
 * <h3>Instance Reuse</h3>
 * Instances of {@link IRule} are meant to be immutable and maintain no internal
 * state which makes them safe for reuse among multiple instances of
 * {@link XMLParser}.
 * <h3>Rule Format</h3>
 * The format of a location path is like a simple XPath rule with no
 * expressions, for example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * /library/book/title
 * </pre>
 * 
 * would point the "title" element inside of the "book" element which is inside
 * the "library" element. If you are after a specific attribute of that element,
 * simply provide its name as an attribute argument.
 * <h3>Rule Format - Namespaces</h3>
 * Referring to a namespace-qualified element in an XML doc is easy; whether it
 * is part of the location path or an attribute name, all you have to do is
 * prefix the local name of the element with brackets ([]) and the full
 * namespace URI within the brackets, like:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * /library/[http://w3.org/texts]book/title
 * </pre>
 * 
 * In the example above, the "book" element is from a namespace defined by
 * "http://w3.org/texts". Inside the actual XML markup, it is likely written
 * with a friendly URI prefix that is defined at the top of the file, and would
 * look more like this: <em>
 * &lt;txt:books&gt;
 * </em> but using the URI prefixes is not exact, as they can change from
 * document to document, so SJXP requires that you reference the namespace using
 * the URI itself, and not a prefix.
 * <p/>
 * In the case where the attribute itself is namespace-qualified, like
 * <em>&lt;item rdf:about="blah" /&gt;</em>, you use the same notation for the
 * attribute name, in this case (assuming the official RDF namespace) the
 * attribute name argument you would actually return would look like this:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  [http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#]about
 * </pre>
 * 
 * It can look a little confusing, but it is exact and won't lead to
 * impossible-to-debug scenarios.
 * <h3>Rule Format - Default Namespaces</h3>
 * Some XML files will define a default namespace using the <code>xmlns</code>
 * argument, by itself, in the header. If your document does this, any tag in
 * the document that isn't defined with a namespace prefix, will have to be
 * referenced with the default namespace because that is how the XML file is
 * technically defined.
 * <p/>
 * An example of this is Slashdot's RDF feed
 * (http://rss.slashdot.org/Slashdot/slashdot); a default namespace of
 * "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/" is defined, so all un-prefixed tags in the
 * document (like &lt;title&gt;, &lt;link&gt; or &lt;description&gt;) all need
 * to be qualified with that default URI, looking like this:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  [http://purl.org/rss/1.0/]title
 * </pre>
 * 
 * when you define the location path for those parse elements.
 * <p/>
 * It is important to be aware of this aspect of XML files otherwise you will
 * run into scenarios where you can't understand why the parse value isn't being
 * passed to you.
 * <h3>Location Path &amp; Attribute Name Strictness</h3>
 * The implementation of SJXP is all based around strict name and namespace URI
 * matching. If you do not specify a namespace URI for your element or attribute
 * names, then only non-namespace-qualified elements will be looked for and
 * matched; and visa-versa.
 * <p/>
 * If the XML content you are parsing is sloppy and you aren't sure if the
 * values will be qualified correctly in every case, you will need to define 2
 * {@link IRule}s; 1 for non-namespace-qualified values and 1 for
 * namespace-qualified values.
 * <p/>
 * The SJXP library was purposefully designed to be pedantic to avoid "fuzzy"
 * behavior that becomes maddening to debug in edge-case scenarios where you
 * can't figure out why it is working one minute and breaking the next.
 * <p/>
 * Given the need of XML parsing in everything from video games to banking
 * applications, SJXP had to take a very conservative approach and be as
 * pedantic as possible so as not to hide any behavior from the caller.
 * 
 * @param <T>
 *            The class type of any user-supplied object that the caller wishes
 *            to be passed through from one of the {@link XMLParser}'s
 *            <code>parse</code> methods directly to the handler when an
 *            {@link IRule} matches. This is typically a data storage mechanism
 *            like a DAO or cache used to store the parsed value in some
 *            valuable way, but it can ultimately be anything. If you do not
 *            need to make use of the user object, there is no need to
 *            parameterize the class.
